## Midterm Self-Assessment Assignment

**Please submit as a PDF that conforms to [my PDF formatting rules](http://drewloewe.net/electronic-document-formatting-rules/).**

### What this is, why we do it

I use contract grading and specifications, not points or percentages. I am trying to encourage students to take charge of their own learning, to focus on improving as writers, and to develop and strengthen behaviors that correlate with success. 

This midterm self-assessment lets us (you, the student; me, the teacher) "check in with" each other on how you are doing so far, to identify lessons learned, and plan for the future. I use this assignment as a way of seeing whether your perception and my perception match, and to help tailor my guidance to you. 

### How to do this

*   Reread the [basic grading contract](https://github.com/drewloewe/grading-contract/blob/master/grading-contract-Summer19-and-later.md) so that you understand the approach that this course uses. 
*   Open the Canvas gradebook and see what I have entered as your grades so far for work that has been completed. (Make sure that you reread the grading contract's sections that describe the compromises forced on us by the shortcomings of Canvas's lousy gradebook so you can truly understand what the grades mean.) This will be only a snapshot at this point, because you will have projects and activities upcoming, and projects may be pending revision. 
*  In F2F courses, view your attendance information in Canvas.
*  Beyond just reviewing grades and attendance, **reread feedback I have given you on projects, as well as the assignments themselves**.
Make notes on what you observe in those rereadings.
*  Reflect on your approach to the course and your performance so far. Are you meeting your goals? Exceeding them? Not meeting them? What have you done so far and what might you do differently?
*  Then, answer the questions of this self-assessment assignment as fully and honestly as you can. **Remember the power of specific pointing phrases such as "For example,...", In particular,...", "What stands out the most is...", and the like.** Specifics count.
*  You'll need about 300 words per paragraph (so, about 900 words total) to do this project completely yet concisely.
* Note: you will see a percentage grade in Canvas because the attendance feature works only with percentages. That percentage shows the percentage of class meetings that you have attended so far. **Don't be misled into thinking that the percentage for attendance is your current course grade progress. Your course grade depends on performance (or non-performance) of the grading contract.**

### Required Questions of Assignment

Please answer all of these questions in one paragraph per section, using these specific headings to label the sections:

**1. Expectations and Goals** 

*   What, specifically, did you expect to learn so far in this course? 
*   What, specifically, have your goals for the course been so far? 
*   How has your approach to the course so far helped you learn what you expected to learn and achieve your goals?


**2. Performance** 

* Have you completed all the assignments and done all the quizzes and activities? 
* How has your performance been so far? Are you on track to earn a B under the basic contract? 
* How, if at all, have you improved as a writer so far? 
* What specific strategies have you used to find a way through confusion, hang-ups, procrastination, your workload and life outside of class, lack of experience, or unfamiliarity with the work? These might include using the Writing Center, coming to my office, asking me questions, and other strategies too numerous to name here.


**3. Ownership of Learning**

*   Have you been coming to class regularly, on time, and prepared? Have you taken proactive steps to avoid distractions, such as social media or texting (except for emergencies) during class time (in F2F classes) or work time? If so, how consistent were you? Have you found ways to improve so far?
*   Have you made specific note of any problems and questions and brought them to class to share?
* Have you sought guidance outside of the classroom (office/Zoom visits, Writing Center, other)? If so, what, and how consistently? How has that helped, or not?
* Which specific areas do you want to improve on in this class?
* What is your concrete, specific plan to improve in those areas during the rest of the class?


### Specifications

| Above spec-3 |  On spec-2 | Below spec-1 | Not completed-0 |
|------------| --------- |-----------|-----------|

I will assign you single holistic grade on this project based on your overall performance on the following criteria:

### Content and Focus

*   All questions answered fully and clearly, with specifics?
*  Abundant evidence of digging into the questions, not just going through the motions?

### Form, Mechanics, Voice, Usage

*   Shows careful attention throughout to editing and proofreading. Unhampered by disruptive errors (e.g. comma splice, fused sentence, subject-verb glitches), careless errors (e.g., dropped quotes, it's/its), or mere mistakes (e.g., repeated/missing words, typos).
*   Voice: The sentences throughout sound like a human being communicating something interesting to an equal. Sentences sound like a human being speaking in [a middle-level style between formal and informal](http://drewloewe.net/prose-style/)?
*   Usage: shows careful attention to usage judgments throughout, including those listed [here](https://github.com/drewloewe/editing-and-formatting-guide/blob/master/advice-on-errors-and-usage.md).
