## Final Self-Assessment Assignment

**Please submit as a PDF that conforms to [my PDF formatting rules](http://drewloewe.net/electronic-document-formatting-rules/).**

### What this is, why we do it

This final self-assessment lets us (you, the student; me, the teacher) "check in with" each other again on your intellectual and skill growth, to identify lessons learned, and see what you might carry into the future. I use this assignment as a way of seeing whether your perception and my perception match, and to help tailor my guidance and evaluation. 

### How to do this

*	Reread the [basic grading contract](https://github.com/drewloewe/grading-contract/blob/master/grading-contract-Summer19-and-later.md).
* Reread your midterm self-assessment.
* 	Open the Canvas gradebook and see what I have entered as your grades so far. This work includes major written assignments, peer review, quizzes, activities, etc. It will also include assignments that are still eligible for revision, so it is still a snapshot.
* In F2F courses, [view your attendance information in Canvas](https://guides.instructure.com/m/4212/l/643081-how-do-i-view-my-roll-call-attendance-report-as-a-student).
*  Beyond just reviewing grades and attendance, reread feedback I have given you on projects, as well as on the assignments themselves.
*  Make notes on what you observe. **A self-assessment that ignores the feedback I have given gets a guaranteed "below-spec" grade.**
*  Reflect on your approach to the course, and your performance over the semester. Did you meet your goals? Exceed them? Not meet them? Overcome challenges? Self-sabotage? What did you do and what will you do in the future?
*  Then, answer the questions of this self-assessment assignment as fully and honestly as you can. Remember the power of specific pointing phrases such as "For example,...", In particular,...", "What stands out the most is...", and the like.
*  Discuss all your work, not just the work on the major assignments (so, peer review and other features of the course). 
*  You'll need about 300 new words per new paragraph (so, about 900 new words total) to do this project completely yet concisely. **Here is why I use the term "new" paragraphs: you'll include, verbatim, your original paragraphs from the midterm self-assessment into this document, then write your new paragraphs answering the same questions from the point of view of having completed the semester.** Make your document look like [this example](https://stedwards.box.com/s/wu1vfvge4rw0jny4avtqvk2xpyo91nbj). Use that example as a template.

### Required Questions of Assignment: Respond to Your Midterm Self-Assessment

*   Please answer all of these questions in one new paragraph per section, **preceded by the text that you wrote for that section in the midterm self-assessment.** 

*   Be sure to include, verbatim, your paragraph from the midterm self-assessment for that section (see the template). **Use these specific headings** to label the sections and **answer these questions**:

**1. Required: Expectations and Goals** 

* 	What, specifically, were your goals for the course? 
* 	How did your approach to the course help you learn what you expected to learn and achieve your goals?
*	What, specifically, did you learn in this course? 


**2. Required: Performance** 

*	Did you complete all the assignments and do all the quizzes and activities? 
* How was your performance? Did you meet the expectations for a B under the basic contract? Exceed them? 
* How, if at all, did you improve as a writer, thinker, editor, analyst, researcher, or arguer? 
* What specific strategies did you use to find a way through confusion, hang-ups, procrastination, your workload and life outside of class, lack of experience, or unfamiliarity with the work?


**3. Required: Ownership of Learning**

*	Did you come to class prepared (F2F classes) and participate (all classes) regularly? If so, how consistent were you? Did you find ways to improve in this way?
*	Did you made specific notes about problems and questions and bring them to class to share (F2F classes)/share them electronically (online classes)?
* Did you seek guidance outside of the classroom (office visits, Zoom hours, Writing Center, other)? If so, what, and how consistently? How did that help (or not help)? If not, why not?
* Which specific areas did you want to improve on in this class?
* What was your concrete, specific plan to improve in those areas during the second half of the class? How did you do in carrying out that plan?
* What will you carry forward out of this class into the future? 

### Optional Section: Grade Argument (Include if you wish--no obligation)

Here, you may make a reasonable, supported argument to me about what overall course grade you believe is warranted. I do want to hear from you since I try to defer ultimate assigning of a course grade until I have all the evidence and your input as a grownup.

Argue for a particular overall course grade and *support your arguments*. Just stating a general wish for a certain grade or identifying as a certain kind of student who usually receives X type of grade are not arguments. But you get to give an informed opinion as a grownup. I will consider your supported arguments (I am not bound by them, but I will at least consider them, if supported).

I am not bound by your arguments, but I will consider them if they are supported. Here, argument = reasonable claim + sufficient evidence + warranted inferences. Wishes, mere pleas, and schmoozing are not arguments. This is your chance to show me the full picture beyond my own recollections, comments, and gradebook and to use the in-between grades meaningfully. Make this section, if you choose to submit it, work hand-in-hand with the rest of the final self-assessment. I cannot promise you a specific grade, but I can promise you that I will at least listen to well-supported arguments.

### Specifications

Without feedback (given the university's tight deadline for turning in grades), I will assign you single holistic grade on this project based on your overall performance on the following criteria and using a simple binary scale:

&#10004; Complete

*   All required questions answered fully and clearly, with specifics and support for observations or generalizations?
*  Abundant evidence of the writer digging into the questions and providing a thoughtful, detailed reflection on an adult learning experience?
*   Careful attention throughout to editing and proofreading. Unhampered by disruptive errors (e.g. comma splice, fused sentence, subject-verb glitches), careless errors (e.g., dropped quotes, it's/its), or mere mistakes (e.g., repeated/missing words, typos).
*   The sentences throughout sound like a human being communicating something interesting to an equal. Sentences sound like a human being speaking in [a middle-level style between formal and informal](http://drewloewe.net/prose-style/)?
*   Shows careful attention to usage judgments throughout, including those listed [here](https://github.com/drewloewe/editing-and-formatting-guide/blob/master/advice-on-errors-and-usage.md).

&#10008; Incomplete

* Not turned in, or turned in but without meeting specifications, probably because it was superficial and vague
