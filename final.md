## Final Self-Assessment Assignment

### What this is, why we do it

This final self-assessment lets us (you, the student; me, the teacher) "check in with" each other again on your intellectual and skill growth, to identify lessons learned, and see what you might carry into the future. I use this assignment as a way of seeing whether your perception and my perception match, and to help tailor my guidance and evaluation. 

### How to do this

*	Reread the [basic grading contract](https://github.com/drewloewe/grading-contract/blob/master/grading-contract.md).
* Reread your midterm self-assessment.
* 	Open the Canvas gradebook and see what I have entered as your grades so far. This work includes major written assignments, peer review, quizzes, activities, etc. It will also include assignments that are still eligible for revision. 
*  [View your attendance information in Canvas](https://guides.instructure.com/m/4212/l/643081-how-do-i-view-my-roll-call-attendance-report-as-a-student).
*  Beyond just reviewing grades and attendance, reread feedback I have given you on projects, as well as the assignments themselves.
*  Make notes on what you observe. A self-assessment that ignores the feedback I have given gets a guaranteed "below-spec" grade.
*  Reflect on your approach to the course, and your performance over the semester. Did you meet your goals? Exceed them? Not meet them? Overcome challenges? Self-sabotage? What did you do and what will you do in the future?
*  Then, answer the questions of this self-assessment assignment as fully and honestly as you can. Remember the power of specific pointing phrases such as "For example,...", In particular,...", "What stands out the most is...", and the like.
*  Discuss all your work, not just the work on the major assignments (so, peer review and other features of the course)
*  You'll need about 300 words per new paragraph (so, about 900 new words total) to do this project completely yet concisely. **Here is why I use the term "new" paragraphs: you'll include, verbatim, your original paragraphs from the midterm self-assessment into this document, then write your new paragraphs answering the same questions from the point of view of having completed the semester.** Make your document look like [this example](https://stedwards.box.com/s/wu1vfvge4rw0jny4avtqvk2xpyo91nbj). You might even use that as a template.
* Note: you will see a percentage grade in Canvas because the attendance feature works only with percentages. That percentage shows the percentage of class meetings that you have attended so far. **Don't be misled into thinking that the percentage for attendance is your current course grade progress. Your course grade depends on performance (or non-performance) of the grading contract.**

### Required Questions of Assignment: Respond to Your Midterm Self-Assessment

*   Please answer all of these questions in one new paragraph per section, **preceded by the text that you wrote for that section in the midterm self-assessment.** 

*   Be sure to include, verbatim, your paragraph from the midterm self-assessment for that section (see the template). **Use these specific headings** to label the sections and **answer these questions**:

**1. Expectations and Goals** 

*	What, specifically, did you learn in this course? 
* 	What, specifically, were your goals for the course? 
* 	How did your approach to the course help you learn what you expected to learn and achieve your goals?


**2. Performance** 

*	Did you complete all the assignments and do all the quizzes and activities? 
* How was your performance? Did you meet the expectations for a B under the basic contract? 
* How, if at all, did you improve as a writer? 
* What specific strategies did you use to find a way through confusion, hang-ups, procrastination, your workload and life outside of class, lack of experience, or unfamiliarity with the work?


**3. Ownership of Learning**

*	Did you come to class regularly, on time, and prepared? If so, how consistent were you? Did you find ways to improve in this way?
*	Did you made specific note of problems and questions to bring them to class to share?
* Did you seek guidance outside of the classroom (office visits, Writing Center, other)? If so, what, and how consistently? How did that help (or not help)?
* Which specific areas did you want to improve on in this class?
* What was your concrete, specific plan to improve in those areas during the second half of the class? How did you do?
* What will you carry forward out of this class into the future? 


### Specifications

| Above spec |  On spec | Below spec |
|------------| --------- |-----------|

Without feedback (given the university's tight deadline for turning in grades), I will assign you single holistic grade of "above spec," "on spec," or "below spec" on this project based on your overall performance on the following criteria:

### Content and Focus

*	All questions answered fully and clearly, with specifics?
*  Abundant evidence of digging into the questions, not just going through the motions?

### Form and Mechanics

-	Paragraphs from midterm self-assessment pasted in and clearly labeled before paragraphs from final self-assessment?

-   Unhampered by 

	-	disruptive errors (e.g. comma splice, fused sentence, sentence fragment), 
	- careless errors (e.g., dropped quotes, typos, itâ€™s/its), 
	- and mere mistakes (e.g., repeated words, typos?)

	-	*Tip: Please refer to [my error and usage guide on GitHub](https://github.com/drewloewe/editing-and-formatting-guide/blob/master/advice-on-errors-and-usage.md).*

-   Sentences sound like a human being speaking?

-   Shows careful attention to editing and proofreading?
